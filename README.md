Expo Client supports running any project that doesn't have custom native modules added.

- Start your project with Expo
  - Install the CLI `npm i -g expo-cli`
  - Start the project `expo start`
- Open the project:
  - Sign in to expo and the project will appear in the app.
  - Or point your phone's camera at the QR code in the terminal (press "c" to view it).
